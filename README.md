## Hi there 👋

- 🤔 I’m exploring ways to make my startup ([Nextify](https://nextify.ltd/)) self-sustaining.
- 🚀 I’m putting a lot of effort into increasing the popularity of my open-source project, [Saasfly](https://github.com/saasfly/saasfly).
- 🔭 @nextify2025 and I launched the open-source V0/Lovable alternative, [Libra AI](https://libra.dev/).
- 🌍 I’m a writer at heart, but I also love to explore the world when I can.
- 🌊 In the AI era, I want to ride the wave forward.
